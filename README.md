# BotaniAI: Installation and Setup Guide

Welcome to BotaniAI, an innovative project that brings together plant enthusiasts and technology. Follow the steps below to install and run the project seamlessly.

## Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and open it in your favorite IDE.

2. **Firebase Project Setup:**
    - Create a new project in the Firebase Console. Need help? Check out the [Firebase Console Project creation guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).
    - Open the Apps section of your project in Firebase Console, locate the Web App, and open it to find the Firebase Config data.

3. **Firebase Function Setup:**
    - To run the classification model, you'll need to host your own Firebase Function. Follow the official [Firebase Functions tutorial](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started?gen=2nd) to set up Firebase Functions. Note: Overwrite the existing files as Firebase Functions are already initialized.
    - Add the location of your hosted Python Firebase Function by appending a line to the `firebase-config.js` file.

4. **Expo Google Login Setup:**
    - To enable Google login on Expo, you need Expo Google login keys. Create these keys by following the [Expo Google Authentication tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/google-authentication/).

5. Create a new JavaScript file named `firebase-config.js` inside the `Frontend/firebase` folder. Use the Firebase Config data, Firebase Function location, and Expo Google login keys to populate the file. The structure should resemble the example below:
```js
export const API_KEY="API_KEY_VALUE"
export const AUTH_DOMAIN="AUTH_DOMAIN_VALUE"
export const PROJECT_ID="PROJECT_ID_VALUE"
export const STORAGE_BUCKET="STORAGE_BUCKET_VALUE"
export const MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="MESSAGING_SENDER_ID_VALUE"
export const APP_ID="APP_ID_VALUE"
export const FUNCTIONS_REGION="FUNCTIONS_REGION_VALUE"
export const GOOGLE_ANDROID="GOOGLE_ANDROID_VALUE"
export const GOOGLE_IOS="GOOGLE_IOS_VALUE"
export const GOOGLE_EXPO="GOOGLE_EXPO_VALUE"
```

6. If you choose not to use Firebase Functions, make sure to comment out the relevant code sections, but note that the app may lose some key features.

7. Install the project dependencies by running the following command inside the `Frontend` directory:
```
npm i
```

8. Start the application using the following command:
```
npx expo start
```

9. You can now view the mobile app in ExpoGo by scanning the QR code! üì±üîç

## Backend Setup

1. **MongoDB Setup:**
    - Create a MongoDB database to store backend data.
    - Copy the database connection link.

2. Create an `.env` file inside the `Backend` directory and paste the MongoDB connection link into the file, as shown below:
```
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017/database_name
```

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command inside the `Backend` directory:
```
npm i
```

4. Start the backend server by running the following command in the `Backend` folder:
```
node server.js
```
